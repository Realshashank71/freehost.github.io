        <li> <dt>Reduce Deforestation</dt>
        <dd>Villagers are one of the stakeholders of forests. They obtain fuel, fruits, wood, etc. from forests. Deforestation reduces these available resources, and freely moving uninhabited animals also pose a danger for the villagers.<br>
          Trees prevent soil erosion by holding the soil. Deforestation leads to soil erosion and eventually it causes floods. Floods hamper the agricultural activities in the rural areas. The villagers' life is at stake as they are completely dependent on agriculture for food and their daily sources.

       <li>  <dt>Promote Children Education</dt>
        <dd> Education can level the playing field for children in rural communities and provide them with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed. In addition to academic benefits, education also helps children develop socially and emotionally.<br>
        Education helps a child become a confident individual. It teaches them how to socialise with people in society, outside their family, and more. It als.o helps a child interact with people of different beliefs, ages, genders, backgrounds, and a lot more.</dd>

       <li>  <dt>Provide Relief During Catastrophes
        </dt>
        <dd>Having sufficient supplies such as food, water, medicine and emergency essentials is important. Local officials and relief workers will be on the scene after a disaster but they cannot reach everyone immediately. You could get help in hours or it might take days.<br>
        Natural disasters can cause damage to communities' infrastructure and even community members' mental health. Rural communities often confront disasters with limited resources, expertise, and capacity.</dd></dl></ul>
